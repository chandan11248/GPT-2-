    "Reason 1: For stability in learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function is sensitive to the magnitudes of its inputs. When the inputs are large, the differences between the exponential values of each input become much more pronounced. This causes the softmax output to become \"peaky,\" where the highest value receives almost all the probability mass, and the rest receive very little.\n",
    "\n",
    "In attention mechanisms, particularly in transformers, if the dot products between query and key vectors become too large (like multiplying by 8 in this example), the attention scores can become very large. This results in a very sharp softmax distribution, making the model overly confident in one particular \"key.\" Such sharp distributions can make learning unstable,"
